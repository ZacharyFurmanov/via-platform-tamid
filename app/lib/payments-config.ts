// VYA earns a seller subscription (primary) PLUS a per-order application fee taken
// off the top of each direct charge (secondary). Never hardcode the fee or the
// subscription price anywhere else — import from here.
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Revenue model: the seller's monthly SUBSCRIPTION is the primary revenue; a
// small per-transaction commission rides on top. Both numbers are still being
// figured out — they live here so there's one place to change them.

 // Seller subscription to be on VYA (the primary revenue). Billed via Stripe
 // Billing against sellers.stripe_customer_id (subscription flow wired later).
 // priceCents is a placeholder until the plan is finalized.
