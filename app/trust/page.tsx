 title: "We review their authentication process",
 body: "We ask every store how they verify authenticity — whether that's in-house inspection, third-party authenticators like Entrupy or CheckCheck, Certificates of Authenticity, or a combination. Stores that can't speak to their process don't make the cut.",
 },

 number: "03",
 title: "We check their track record",

 title: "Authentic Vintage & Secondhand",
