            Anna, a 28-year-old reseller based in Menlo Park, CA, has always loved bougie,
            beautiful things with a story to tell.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a hyper-commercialized world that insists on putting polyester in everything
            we touch and is constantly pushing us to consume, consume, and consume some more,
            it&apos;s comforting just to hold something well-made, something that you could tell
            was made with heart. She wants to bring this feeling to more people, and that&apos;s
            why she started Vintage Girlfriend Luxury.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike the big players in the industry that give resellers a bad rap, the store
            upholds authenticity and transparency as the bare minimum so anyone, anywhere,
            can shop preowned luxury without worry.
          </p>

            At vya, our mission is to make it easier to discover the best independent vintage
            boutiques and designer resale stores in one place. Vintage Girlfriend is exactly
            why vya exists — a founder who genuinely believes in what she sells, and holds
            herself to a standard that makes shopping secondhand feel safe.
