            Source 24 is a vintage destination built on the idea that the best fashion
            already has a story. Founded by a mother&ndash;daughter duo in New Jersey,
            the brand grew from their shared tradition of searching for hidden designer
            treasures and turning those discoveries into a thoughtfully curated collection
            for others to enjoy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The collection focuses heavily on luxury accessories from iconic fashion
            houses. You&apos;ll often find Burberry leather purses, Balenciaga archive bags,
            Bottega Veneta wallets, and classic Celine totes — pieces that represent the
            enduring craftsmanship of European luxury design. These are items chosen for
            their longevity, designed to move seamlessly from one wardrobe to the next.
          </p>

            At VYA, we love highlighting independent vintage boutiques that prioritize
            authentic designer accessories, sustainable luxury fashion, and thoughtfully
            curated resale. Source Twenty Four is exactly that.
