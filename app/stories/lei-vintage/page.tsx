            Some brands start with a new collection. LEI started with a realization.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Leila began dreaming about building her own clothing line, she hit a
            truth she couldn&apos;t ignore&mdash;the world doesn&apos;t need more clothes. It
            needs better choices. So instead of adding to the noise, she chose to
            rewind it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inspired by a closet full of secondhand treasures and a lifelong habit of
            &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; from her mom&apos;s beautifully curated collection, LEI was
            built on the idea that the best style already exists. Think timeless
            designer clothes, heritage luxury brands, and elegant designer pieces
            crafted to last far beyond a single season. Each piece is sourced for its
            quality, character, and quiet ability to become someone&apos;s forever staple.
          </p>

          <p>
            LEI isn&apos;t about more. It&apos;s about meaning. About choosing timeless fashion
            over temporary. About rediscovering luxury fashion that has already proved
            itself.
          </p>

          <p className="font-serif text-black text-xl">
            Exactly the kind of story we&apos;re proud to bring to VIA.
          </p>
